# Pet Management game

## Intro

This Pet Management Game prototype is used for my Degree FYP. This game focuses on two main features, which is the interaction with virtual pet and minigames. Minigames provide variety of game mechanics, including character movement control using computer vision and speech recognition.

## Getting started

This game is developed in Node.js environment. Ensuring Node.js is installed locally can prevent any issues. Importing the database .sql file locally is also necessary for the game to work.

To start the game, simply redirect to server folder in a command prompt or a terminal.

Type `node app.js` to initiate the Node.js server environment.

Now you can access the game through a web browser using URL `localhost:3000` or `127.0.0.1:3000`

## Project status

Fundamental of this game is complete. Developer can add contents in the future without altering the base functions

## Future updates

**Probably no more updates**
